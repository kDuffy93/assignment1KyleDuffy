             <p>Im currently attending Georgian College and am in my 5th semester of the
                 computer programmer analyst course.I have wored with and been exposed to many
                 different technologies and langues since i started my program including:
                 Php, Html5, css3, python, Java, Javascript, jQuery & jQueryMobile, the MEAN stack,
                 mySql, sqlServer, db2, Cordova/PhoneGap and many more, aswell as being exposed to different resources
                 for programming such as MS Visio, MS project, Git, Bootstrap, w3Schools, FileZilla aswell
                 as many other online resources. Ive experienced different BI reporting tools such as Cognos
                 and PowerBI. Weve looked into different aspects of project planning like SCRUM & AGILE vs Waterfall
                 and, on a less technical note, we also focused a little bit on orginizational behavior
                 and different principles of managment.
